    <Content>This essay was written in April and June 2020, during India’s first COVID-19 lockdown, and bears the marks of that astonishing moment. The lockdown, as is well known, was announced on March 24, 2000 under the Disaster Management Act, 2005 by the sudden appearance of India’s prime minister on national television giving four-hour notice before effectively shutting the country. All access to the physical public domain was declared illegal and all travel suspended, leaving millions of Indians not only in a space of considerable legal jeopardy, as they could not prove their identity, their address or their need to travel, but also in a physically precarious space that threatened their very survival.</Content>

    <Content>It did seem, that April and May, that several things had come to a head. It also seemed that an unusual clarity had somehow descended upon us all – not only a clarity about what was being attempted by the government, but also where it was coming from. Eight months earlier, in August 2019, similar restrictions on public movement had been enhanced by the longest and most severe internet shutdown the world has seen, in the state of Kashmir. And a scant four months earlier, nationwide protests had taken place against the 2019 amendment to the Citizenship Act, 1955, whose incendiary Section 2 (1)(b) was widely construed as directly targeting Muslim migrants. The protests clubbed together four disparate initiatives by the state: the Citizenship (Amendment) Act, 2019 (CAA) together with a revised Unlawful Activities (Prevention) Act, 1967 (UAPA) that could now designate individuals as terrorists, the National Register of Citizenship (NRC), and the technology that was believed to have been the one that enabled it all, India’s much-discussed Aadhaar or biometric authentication system.</Content>

    <Content>That April, as the jailed students (under UAPA) of the Jamia Millia Islamia University came together with the parallel images of millions upon millions of India’s displaced migrants walking across the length of the subcontinent, or taking whatever means of transport they could to escape the stranglehold of quarantine, something appeared to click together. Even as images of the laborers incessantly evoked the Partition of India, the last time such a scale of subcontinental upheaval had taken place, it became clear that questions of identity – and the regulatory mechanisms defining it – needed, historically, conceptually, and politically, to take on a similar span. You could not account for the Disaster Management Act or the several technologies of ‘contact tracing’ it brought in (most notably the Arogya Setu health app) without at the same time looking at the history of legislation that went back to the Information Technology Act, 2000 (IT Act), and to several other acts, bills and rules redefining citizenship that went hand-in-hand with new digital technologies ‘targeting’ India’s populace as recipients of state benefit.</Content>

    <Content>This essay retells what is to some a familiar story – or at least a recent and well-known moment in history – from that particular, if temporary, vantage point. There is wide acceptance that India, like several other nation-states in different parts of the world, is seeing a totalitarian turn in its governance. This is not new. India has previously seen, in 1975, the formal suspension of civil rights, and has also seen in several regions within the nation – from Kashmir to Chhattisgarh and across the Northeast – military action under special powers that looks a lot like the Emergency, with significant curbs on public movement, the imposition of censorship, and the incarceration of political dissidents.</Content>

    <Content>What may well be new, however, was the political weaponization of the massive digital infrastructure assembled since the 90s. This infrastructure, which initially saw the famous information technology revolution in the early 2000s, followed by the targeted delivery of state benefit to consumers, beneficiaries, and citizens (label depending on the nature of the benefit), also undergirded a massive neoliberal state apparatus whose consequences may only now be apparent.</Content>

    <Content>For all its immediacy, the story may well go back a long way. The fragmentation of ‘the people’ – the ‘we’ who wrote the Constitution of India – into multiple rights and duties also dispersed ‘the people’ into numerous new categories. These include, among others, the ‘natural person’ and ‘digital principal’ of the draft Personal Data Protection Bill, 2019, the ‘terrorist’ of the UAPA, and the ‘hacker’ of the IT Act. Negotiating one’s digital existence includes new questions basic to the idea of identity, ranging from bodily incarceration and what one major Supreme Court judgment called ‘civil death’ to an increasingly invisible ‘virtuality’.</Content>

    <Content>This story is told here in bold strokes, over five parts that foreground the conception of ‘creep’ or the phenomenon of how tools, devices, structures, or modes develop a purpose far removed from their initial conception. The first part, addressing the embodied sovereign subject, opens vexed questions of citizenship going back to India’s Independence and beyond. The second more specifically addresses Aadhaar, the promise and the revision, suggesting a tactical maneuver – of two Aadhaars, one small and nimble, the other a larger data guzzler acting at the behest of the state – and an element of ‘creep’ literally built into the system. The third addresses Justice D.Y. Chandrachud’s much-celebrated dissenting judgment on the 2018 Aadhaar case in the Supreme Court, locating his view within a tradition of social science addressing the question of identity in the Indian subcontinent. The fourth looks at the basic transformation in the conceptions of ‘people’ and ‘citizen’ as India moves into a new, many argue, more draconian regime of digital management of civil society. The fifth part primarily addresses the Kashmir internet shutdown and looks at the link between freedom of speech and the right to free movement in the public domain – a right directly threatened by the 2020 lockdown.</Content>

Although there have been several earlier amendments to the original Act (in 1992, 2003, 2005, and 2015), this was the first time that religion was specifically mentioned as a criterion for citizenship. The earlier December 2003 amendment had introduced the concept of illegal immigrants, thereby also reversing a basic principle of citizenship, namely the right to the soil as against inheritance and descent. The 2003 amendment also introduced the controversial National Register of Citizens (NRC), implemented in practice only in Assam.</Content>

    <Content>It is widely accepted that Delhi police did nothing to stop these riots. On February 26, 2020, the Delhi High Court heard an emergency plea to urgently step in and ensure both accountability and immediate police action. A two-judge bench chastised the police for their failure in bringing to book the pro-BJP leadership whose inflammatory speeches as well as active role in the riots had been widely recorded. That night, the bench was replaced and one of the justices, S. Muralidhar, transferred. The following day, another bench accepted with alacrity the solicitor general’s claim that the abnormality of the situation, with passions inflamed everywhere, made it not ‘conducive’ for any action against the riot instigators. The authorities were given six weeks to comfortably rethink their strategy.</Content>

In late March, a nationwide lockdown was declared, initially for three weeks but extended four times thereafter, leaving millions of migrant laborers stranded in conditions of extreme hunger and penury. This lockdown was authorized by an unusual emergency measure: a time-bound Order issued on March 24, 2020 invoking the Disaster Management Act, 2005. The Ministry of Home Affairs decided that it was ‘satisfied that the country is threatened’ and that ‘effective measures’ were needed.</Content>

As ‘[legal] procedures, which otherwise provide tighter rules regarding evidence’ become ‘elastic’, jail ‘becomes the norm, and bail an exception […] [the] process itself becomes punishment’.</Content>

    <Content>This essay does not deal with the specific legal situation that Safoora Zargar and her colleagues face. Nor does it deal with the condition of migrant labor during the pandemic, trapped as they were in a major crisis of identity, somewhere between work and home. I shall attempt instead to address what seems to be a techno-normative maneuver that brings together several of the key issues in which both the arrested students and the stranded laborers find themselves implicated. The National Population Register or NPR, the ‘video footages, technical &amp; other footprints’ that the police claim to have as the basis for Zargar’s arrest, the modified UAPA, and the astonishing Emergency powers that the pandemic vested in the hands of the state at the time of writing all come together to allow the authorities to say that both Zargar and the migrant laborers were quarantined, jailed or stranded </Content>

As data (together with the sole right to interpret it) becomes state property, so does its unique authority to define the social good get weaponized. A populist abstraction of the ‘people’ has increasingly been turned against actual people, who no longer have any say in what is being done in their name and apparently for their own good. Citizens as conscious and autonomous subjects, capable of comprehending the responsibilities that go with key constitutional rights, are replaced by populations to be ‘managed’ and symbolized by individuated bodies, identifiable and incarcerable.</Content>

This hierarchy of rights—civil and political on top, social and economic below—appears invincible, though it continues to be frequently attacked. However, the very fact that the grammar of rights is being constantly reinvented through struggle is in itself a testimony to the power of an idea of citizenship in which the core mainstream rights—civil and political—are simultaneously the weapons of achieving the rights on the margins and of the marginal populations, as well as the object or that which is sought to be undermined’.

    <Content>The experience has been rather different, even as digital governance enhanced the Indian state’s enumerative capability to historically inconceivable levels. As populations turned into targeted beneficiaries identified by whatever category of ‘backwardness’ or lack of that qualified them for benefit, many entered the digital gateway on terms that would freeze their status on the poverty line, their qualification for property, and their creditworthiness. Somewhere along the way, a divide between entitlement and welfare also got frozen. The potential redrawing of the blurry and porous character of the ‘last mile problem’ often enhanced social divides as it recast them into a new form of socio-technological rigidity. New questions of source codes and encryption arose even as a new battle over coercion and aspiration came to define, since 2000, the primary location for social rights in India.</Content>

The first recorded some basic demographics: name, age, gender, and travel history. The second, a kind of automated health check, gave a diagnosis for any symptoms you wished to list out: temperature, oxygen saturation levels, and so on. The third gave periodic updates on the pandemic. The fourth, in all probability intended to be the key section for future use, was a digital ‘e-pass’ that worked like a kind of health data aggregator to certify that you are ‘green’ and thus healthy enough to access public utilities.

Her protestations came to nought and she was taken away to be hospitalized and tested. She had apparently installed the Aarogya Setu app earlier that day, leaving many to puzzle out just where the bug lay, and not least why she had been treated like a criminal. Two days later, when a pizza delivery boy in Delhi working for the food delivery service Zomato tested positive, Zomato and several other local delivery services began using ‘Arogya Setu compliance certificates’ issued by a commercial entity named ‘Suraksha Store’, in partnership with the Department of Consumer Affairs, for a fee and in return for a host of further data.</Content>

    <Content>Much of this is because the likely true uses of the Aarogya Setu app, like of all digital governance, are an evolving story, and if precedent is anything to go by, the story will be one of creep. Already, on April 10, 2020, a wing of the Information &amp; Broadcasting Ministry put out a tender for a ‘Covid-19 Patient Tracking Tool’ along with a handheld thermal imager and an optical fever-sensing system. The tracking tool, probably something like a wristband, was meant to ‘pair with Arogya Setu’ to identify what it now quite unambiguously names a ‘suspect’, to ‘identify a suspects behaviour, see what he or she does on specific days of the week, where does he or she order food from, where does the suspect go for regular walks, where does he/she work during the day, where does he/she sleep at night’; identify ‘close contacts, frequent contacts as well as occasional contacts’; ‘trace where this person has been’; ‘collect information like where the suspect has spent most of his/her time and who all he or she has met’; and ‘identify common friends’. Basically, the tracking tool was meant to be an ‘intelligence investigation platform &amp; tactical tool to detect, prevent and investigate threats to national security using CDR, IPDR, Tower, Mobile Phone Forensics Data.’</Content>

Such ambivalence opens a two-level operation of citizenship, an increasingly segregationist approach when the constitutional privileges of citizenship get selectively and diversely distributed to actual people. While normative segregation is historically part of what Sudipta Kaviraj (quoted later in this essay) famously called the ‘enumerated’ community, what may not have been adequately discussed is the ways by which it has been further enabled by digital technology in terms of controls over data gathering, aggregation, and analytics, but also in terms of </Content>

    <Content>Just a little over a decade ago, my coauthors in this volume, Nishant Shah and Nafis Hasan, the lawyer Sruti Chaganti and I led a large team on a major project to research the grassroots social impact of the Aadhaar project, or the ‘Unique Identity for Every Indian Resident’, that had been announced with much fanfare by the Government of India in February 2009. This paper is not about those findings, but it nevertheless emerges from that experience to make a larger argument set in April 2020, the time of writing this essay, even as we see Aarogya Setu reprise the old Aadhaar playbook in startling detail. My revisionist account then, the one I provide here, was not available to us in the period 2009–2011, even though a hindsight reading of several of the findings of the Identity Project do provide initial signs of how things might pan out in the decade that followed.</Content>

    <Content>In February 2009, when the Unique Identification Number (UID) (as we still called it then, the term ‘Aadhaar’ was yet to enter common usage) was announced, there were admittedly reasons to worry. But there was also palpable excitement. The IT revolution still retained the last gasps of its 90s fervor and much of its history was still being written. Although many friends and colleagues perhaps more in tune with the times than us brought up grisly specters of Big Brother, we decided we weren’t going to jump the gun, we wouldn’t predetermine what would happen, for there were two, perhaps three, essential reasons for why we believed this might yet be a political and technology game changer. For one, it promised a technological flattening of hierarchies that had been historically inbuilt into citizen-based identity, and we felt this entire enterprise was very likely going to have unpredictable consequences that we wanted to study in real time. Secondly, it appeared, at least initially, that this flattening would not happen from above, but rather in a way that did not delegitimize the market – it would adopt market-consonant approaches to bridge what we believed was the one ambivalence that needed the deepest possible study: the proverbial ‘last mile’.</Content>

    <Content>New questions arose in our project and new data needed to be studied. What of flaws, not in the methodology but in the very theory of ‘targeting’? When creating new group-differentiated (as against universal) definitions of public distribution to recognize special ‘backward’ categories deserving of special benefit, would the shortcuts to which Chatterjee points – the workarounds of normative protocols – not create potentially more problems than they solved? Could the mere redefinition of politics and democracy into a communications model be a sufficient solution for the shadowy, secondarized, and often covert domain of negotiated state operation that now arose? Was it not inevitable that techno-managerial solutions would paper over what might become foundational cracks between the theory and practice of democracy?</Content>

    <Content>Despite this long history of development communication, two-way and peer-to-peer structures have been incommensurable with the hierarchical self-image of the Indian state. One consequence, as a bureaucrat pointed out during our Identity Project interviews, was that ‘everywhere the state usually steps in when markets fail; in India, markets step in when the state fails’. Access to various kinds of community-market mechanisms that were often hidden, rendered covert and even illegal (the criminalization of bribery, for example) appeared through our field studies a far more trusted lifeline to survival for much of the population than often discredited state benefit, not least because, even at the time, all such state benefit came inevitably with the threat of surveillance, even in, and perhaps especially during, times of crisis. Again, to quote Amartya Sen, the role that markets play ‘depend[s] […] not only on what they can do but also on what they are allowed to do’. While the interests of some people are served by the smooth functioning of markets, there are ‘groups whose established interests may be hurt by such functioning’. Confronting such influences has to occur ‘not merely through resisting – and perhaps even ‘exposing’ – the seekers of profit from captive markets, but also […] taking on their intellectual arguments </Content>

However, from what The Identity Project witnessed at the enrollment centers, residents did not seem to distinguish between the two, nor were they appropriately advised at the Enrollment Centre. So, while UIDAI-mandated Enrollment Forms asked residents to volunteer their bank details, in the AP KYR+, residents were asked to furnish their bank account details without any discernible distinction between it being a mandatory or a voluntary field.</Content>

According to the home ministry, the central intelligence agencies and state police have plenty of information that is not shared or because there is no umbrella organization to collate all the information, which any or all the agencies can share to generate real-time intelligence.

Once you get the data, you can segregate in any way by means of technology. See, you never used identity to support us, never purposely did a proper survey to identify and rehabilitate us.

    <Content>The issue wasn’t creep alone. It was creep stalking a more fundamental slippage. We seemed to be looking at a designed ideological ambivalence in the interoperability system. In a curious twist of fate, Aadhaar not only capitulated to the NPR, it became the NPR’s public face. Chameleon-like, even as it adopted the colors of whatever initiative it came in under, it would end up becoming that initiative. As further mismatches emerged, such slippages became routine: of Aadhar promising something only to have its interoperable partner take it away – just one of numerous instances being when Aadhaar’s culturally sensitive ‘third gender’ category produced mismatches with PAN Cards (presently being cross-linked with Aadhaar) that had built no such category.</Content>

It was part of the design, said Shah, that you and I found ourselves in a digital ecosystem, caught in between two paradoxical imaginations of the individual. On the one side we were a ‘data subject’ and on the other a ‘quantified self’. The data subject was offered a specific capability: of being imagined in such a way that she was ‘no longer confined to the biological discreteness of […] existence’. Such a person became available to the world ‘through an extended relationality enabled by digital traffic flows of ideas, ideologies, and interactions’ – became thereby a </Content>

    <Content> It can become such an actor only if we recognized that we were looking at an ‘indifferent network’. Such a claim of indifference clashed directly with the PR claims made by the 2009 UID working paper which spoke of the caring nature of a data network ‘committed to mapping the individual in all its difference through the constantly expanding databases of quantified measurement’. The facts, to Shah, were rather different: networks were the very opposite of caring, indifferent to ‘the individual and its expressions’. Under the black-and-white ambivalence-free conditions of digital governance, the fiction of the ‘reasonable man’, which has been at the heart of legal regulation and justice, has been absolutely replaced by another set of tools for producing reason and rationality. These tools of reason are self-learning and iterative algorithms that make connections at speeds unfathomable to human faculties. As networks propelled by such tools grow, they ‘reinforce this inherent paradox of the individual as unique – having a unique identifier – but also the individual as […] an actor that can be mined for data, queried, and stored in mobile data sets’.</Content>

    <Content>Arun Mohan Sukumar speaks of another trajectory of colonial anxiety, of what happens if this founding principle of governance fails, in projects that took place as recently as the 90s. In his history of technology in independent India, Sukumar says that the failure of India’s vaccine and genome projects were in large part due to ‘the subcontinent’s long and dismal history of using biological attributes of Indians to serve in the British Raj’. From the mid-19th century, Sukumar shows how fingerprinting had been explicitly linked to criminal tracking, and the Indian Evidence Act of 1899 was the world’s first legislation recognizing this technology. And so it was that when India first piloted automated fingerprint detection in 1992, it was the ‘historical provenance of techniques and technologies that involved harvesting information from the human body [that] made them unpalatable to Indians young and old’. </Content>

It thus possesses a potential for meaning that can appear both terrifying and uncontrolled, across religious and political ideologies.

Control over such a body is thus a crucial signifying site for state sovereignty.

          <Content>The prevalence of ‘hunger amidst plenty’ in India took a new turn in mid 2001, as the country's food stocks reached unprecedented levels while hunger intensified in drought-affected areas and elsewhere. This situation prompted the People’s Union for Civil Liberties (Rajasthan) to approach the Supreme Court with a writ petition on the ‘right to food’. Initially, the case was brought against the Government of India, the Food Corporation of India (FCI), and six state governments, in the specific context of inadequate drought relief. Subsequently, the case was extended to the larger issue of chronic hunger, with all states and union territories as respondents.</Content>

          <Content>The legal basis of the petition is simple. Article 21 of the Constitution is a guarantee of the right to life, and imposes upon the state the duty to protect it. This right is fundamental. The Supreme Court has held in previous cases that the right to life includes the right to live with dignity and all that goes along with it, including the right to food. The petition argues, in essence, that the response to the drought situation by central and state governments, in terms of both policy and implementation, constitutes a clear violation of this right. The bulk of the petition attempts to establish this using (government and field-based) data from Rajasthan.</Content>

          <Content>The petition points out two aspects of the state's negligence in providing food security. The first is the breakdown of the public distribution system (PDS). The failures of the PDS arise at various levels: its availability has been restricted to families living below the poverty line (BPL), yet the monthly quota per family cannot meet the nutritional standards set by the Indian Council of Medical Research (ICMR). Even this is implemented erratically: a survey in Rajasthan indicated that only one-third of the sample villages had regular distribution in the preceding three months, with no distribution at all in one-sixth of them. The identification of BPL households is also highly unreliable. All in all, the assistance provided to BPL households through the PDS amounted to less than INR 5 per person per month.</Content>

Although the entire document is as though written in the name of ‘We the People’, as it unfolds, there is a strange disappearance of ‘the people’ as active agents. As she tries to puzzle out this disappearance, she encounters another slippage that would be of some relevance in the early 2000s.

    <Content> These were legatees of our citizen-subjects capable of individual subjective choice, the small populational percentage of ‘natural subjects’ who actually qualified for privacy. Although the Committee did cast a wide net around data, with significant sections on identifiability, anonymization, community data and nonconsensual data gathering processes, it was firm in its core commitment that ‘the primary value that any data protection framework serves must be that of privacy’. Srikrishna worries about what else should be included in SPD – he considers, for example, adding trade union membership – and is inevitably bothered by the special conditions under which consent is suspended in the name of ‘larger public interest’. There is little evidence here of Justice Chandrachud’s many concerns about the conditions under which the corporeal gets coercively identified by data over which the person has no control, or tagged by technologies, or the possibility of switching off tagging to cause ‘civil death’. Such a body goes simply missing in the Srikrishna Committee report. It appears only in two contexts: as the entity requiring anonymization, or as the entity submitting to involuntary consent.</Content>

Although antipoverty programs were confined to target populations and meant for the poor, Jayal points to a ‘curious bifurcation’ that occurs as elites find themselves in a position to cherry-pick which services they should appropriate and which they had no need for. Some services, such as water and electricity, although subsidized in the name of the poor, become ‘effectively available only to the nonpoor and are sometimes almost exclusively appropriated by the well-off’, whereas others, such as public education and health, for which the elites have no desire, are allowed to decline, since ‘the classes that have political voice do not have any stake in their improvement, while the classes that are entirely dependent on these services lack the voice to effect such change’.</Content>

    <Content>So how were we taken in, in 2009? I still believe that there was good reason why, when we conceived our project and then did fieldwork in seven states in 2010–2011, we located our ‘ambivalence’ in the internecine row between Aadhaar and the NPR. I’ve talked about it earlier in this essay, so shall only add that this almighty row confused not only us, but also many bureaucrats at state and district levels who often assumed that the NPR was simply one of the numerous registrars empaneled by the UIDAI. Indeed, in the solitary reference the UIDAI’s 2009 working paper makes to the NPR, at the bottom of a section titled ‘Enrolment Strategy in Rural and Urban India’, this is just how it represents their connection. Reiterating Aadhaar’s ‘pro-rural/pro-poor’ approach to enrolment, the paper names rural registrars – like NREGA, RSBY and PDS – as ‘government agencies with large rural networks and significant bases among the poor’, which in the cities would be ‘LIC and Passports’. To this, in an oh-by-the-way line, it adds that ‘in addition to these enrollers, the UIDAI will also partner with the Registrar General of India (RGI) – who will prepare the National Population Register through the Census 2011 – to reach as many residents as possible and enroll them into the UID database’, pointing out snootily that this may ‘require incorporating some additional procedures into the RGI data collection mechanism, in order to make it UID-ready’.</Content>

    <Content>The die was thus cast. On January 28, 2009, the UIDAI was formed under the Planning Commission by an executive order. The creep that ensued was, one may now speculate in hindsight, the main reason for the crisis of legitimacy that Aadhaar faced: arguably as a direct result of this design ambivalence, in problems in the ‘collation’ that went beyond issues of methodology or implementation technique, which began to affect legitimacy. A 2010 bill to set up a National Identification Authority of India bit the dust in Parliament, nixed by the Yashwant Sinha-led Standing Committee on Finance. A second bill failed in 2016 when it was sought to be smuggled into Parliament as a money bill, and it squeaked into legality only in 2017 with the epic Supreme Court judgment.</Content>

By mid-2013, around the time our Identity Project came to an end, there was enough evidence of the extent of poison that had entered Drèze’s metaphorical well. Notwithstanding the UIDAI’s own strenuous assertion that it has always kept its data confidential – a requirement that would be enshrined in 2016 under Article 29(1) of the Aadhaar Act, that ‘no core biometric information, collected or created under this Act, shall be shared with anyone for any reason whatsoever; or used for any purpose other than generation of Aadhaar numbers and authentication’ – news has consistently circulated about the uses to which its data was being leaked. In February 2013, the Deputy Director General of the UIDAI, Ashok Dalwai, said that data could be shared with security agencies, particularly for cases relating to national security, on the basis of court orders.</Content>

    <Content>This capacity of collectives to behave like a multi-bodied individual, extensively discussed in theories of group psychology and politically by several strands of the Frankfurt School, has triggered, since colonial times, a major struggle over the meanings that could be attached to political subjecthood. The tension between the ‘citizen’ and the ‘people’ came through modernity to be manifested as a tug-of-war between isolatable and identifiable individuation on one side, and diverse amorphous collectives on the other. A longer historical tension over where the nation’s imagination lay – whether in discrete individual subjects capable of incarnating and acting on their rights under Articles 19 and 21 (and who thus possessed complete control over their SPD) or in fuzzy social groups and communities – would create in the early 2000s a brand new digital iteration of a hoary problem of colonial vintage.</Content>

    <Content>The question who is a legal person? has vexed courts in India. We know that, although a ‘person’ is always an individual, various entities can have ‘juridical personality’ – including, at different points, animals, rivers, corporations and even, as recently seen, deities. Such legal persons are attributed the characteristics of conscious individuals: if they have a name and a reasonable capacity to say ‘I’, they can be ‘clothed with legal personality’.</Content>

If one did, one would presume incorrectly.

    <Content> ‘Narratives’, he concludes, ‘are not for all to hear, for all to participate in to an equal degree’. It is, in short, a very different form of narrative, violating the founding purpose of conventional narratives, which is to open meaning out to the world, comprehensible to all. Narratives aspire, in their very nature, to be universal. Kaviraj’s narratives are none of those. Just as his ‘fuzzy’ community remains elusive to enumeration, creating significant challenges to their legal ‘personhood’, so it appears that the narratives of such a community – ‘not for all to hear’ – create significant challenges to the concept of speech as defined by the doctrine of free speech.</Content>

    <Content>Three major and foundational events in the epochal month of February 2009 would shape the decade to come. There is little that brings the three together other than their simultaneity, and the fact that they were all defined by the emerging threat posed by the shadowy individual-as-amorphous-public. The first we have discussed: it was the ceremonial unveiling of the UIDAI’s heavy artillery in the battle over bodily individuation. A very different kind of event, at a very different register, occurred as one of the earliest effective uses of Facebook for subversive community action. In a high-visibility and stunningly successful campaign against a Hindu right-wing organization’s targeting of young people celebrating Valentine’s Day, a ‘Consortium of Pub-Going, Loose and Forward Women’ put out a call to send gifts of pink knickers to that organization, as a satirical send-up of the khaki shorts that was the uniform of the Rashtriya Swayamsevak Sangh (RSS).</Content>

That amendment, numbered 66A, took direct aim at social media when it threatened imprisonment to anyone sending ‘information that is grossly offensive’ or ‘causing annoyance, inconvenience, danger, obstruction, insult, injury, criminal intimidation, enmity, hatred or ill will’ via ‘a computer, computer system, computer resource or communication device including attachments in text, images, audio, video and any other electronic record’.</Content>

In that post, she wondered whether it was right to close down the city like this, and whether Thackeray was a martyr of the stature of Bhagat Singh and Sukhdev. Later that day, another young woman also from Palghar, Rinu Srinivasan, clicked ‘like’ on Shaheen’s Facebook post. Shaheen was of course expressing her personal opinion, and was thus squarely within the ambit of Article 19(1)(a) that is precisely meant to protect such speech. Rinu on the other hand wasn’t expressing any opinion other than to endorse Shaheen’s view. The following day, however, Mumbai Police made no distinction between the two: they arrested both Shaheen and Rinu under the Section 66A.</Content>

    <Content>As we look at forwards, memes, and other forms of post-authorial diffuse speech, we also go into the somewhat wilder zone of power that was also part of 66A but elusive to the free speech doctrine. Shami Witness’ main point – and indeed the key allegation of Karnataka Police – was that he was an aggregator (he had, said the police charge sheet, 35,000 pages and 122,000 tweets on his account). His defense allows us to reopen the online equivalent of the transactional-contractual apparatus that was a key part of Kaviraj’s narrative community, namely an amalgamation of speaker and recipient into a narrative whose primary purpose, re-quoting Kaviraj, was to ‘draw lines, distribute people’. Justice Rohinton Nariman’s judgment on the 2015 Supreme Court case reveals some awareness of this problem, suggesting that Section 66A raises questions that may be additional to those of the black-letter interpretation of Article 19(1)(a). In the narrow sense, Nariman has no hesitation in agreeing with the petitioners, since the ‘reasonable restrictions’ doctrine of Article 19(2) outlines eight precise categories that might be evoked and no more, and Section 66A falls outside of those.</Content>

Such a concept of information is, for example, the source of a commonly held view of the police that the mere existence of information is sufficient to read meaning into it and to charge someone with a crime.

    <Content>But there would be another way to tell even this story, as the 2000s went on. The further possibility of nonuniversal narratives generating communities through purely horizontal circulation – that there is no content prior to, or following, the disseminative act – would enable Shami Witness, along with numerous other models of communication, from pornography to fan address, to state his case. It would also enable an entirely new career for ‘the people’ generating new kinds of nonuniversal narrative communities. Such communities may well need a reinvoking of the Directive Principles as they take the meaning of citizenship to its liminal extremes.</Content>

    <Content>In September 2015, wireless internet and voice services shut down for a week without public notification in the district of Churachandpur in Manipur, following protests by Kuki groups opposing the introduction of Inner Line Permits. The protests led to arson and violent clashes, apparently in part as a result of the shutdowns, and nine people died in police firing. In an astonishing display of physical occupation, for an entire year the bodies of the nine dead were kept on public display in mauve coffins under a shamiana, in front of which daily speeches occurred under a sign that said ‘Hills &amp; Valley as separate entities: the new normal, learn to live with it’. Apparently, a poster pinned on the wall of Churachandpur police station outside which three of the nine were killed still remains there.</Content>

    <Content> He was once more chastised and informed that ‘the necessity of publication of law is a part of the rule of natural justice’. Then came the question of freedom of speech, and things got even more bizarre. The judgment pointed out that since ‘none of the counsels have argued for declaring the right to access the internet as a fundamental right’, it was deliberately ‘not expressing any view on the same’, but confining itself to ‘declaring that the right to freedom of speech and expression under Article 19(1)(a), and the right to carry on any trade or business under 19(1)(g) […] is constitutionally protected’. When it specifically underlined the right to a free press under this doctrine – which was Anuradha Bhasin’s primary reason to go to court – Mehta argued this time that ‘the jurisprudence on free speech relating to newspapers cannot be applied to the internet’ since ‘newspapers only allowed one-­way communication’ whereas ‘the internet makes two-­way communication’.</Content>

    <Content>. All of these movements can directly and straightforwardly be viewed as a protest against digital identity. They are at once protests against the technological unilateralism of the state, a reappropriation of the physical manifestation of the abstracted ‘people’ as well as a popular re-concretization of the body that – like the corpses on public display for a year in Churachandpur – collectively add up to become also a bid to retake popular sovereignty.</Content>

    <Content>Between 2014 and 2019, these movements took place most prominently on university campuses, where an actual, physical, analogue space existed that literally stood for freedom, as JNU’s now-famous Freedom Square epitomized. In 2019, they spilled out into the streets and into the several occupy initiatives often led by women. Although these were not, or not only, Kaviraj’s primordial communities, they included several features of his fuzzy and nonuniversal narratives, </Content>

    <Content>Several of their strategies of returning to analogue, both as identity and as space, occur in the context of extreme mediatization, and with it of extreme identification and surveillance practices. G. Arunima, who teaches at JNU, names ‘at least three kinds of camera forms that proliferate in universities […] CCTVs, photos and videos taken by security personnel or the administration, those taken by students, and finally a proposal that classrooms could have cameras to facilitate MOOC (Massive Open Online Course) courses’.</Content>

Since now many campus protests, following administrative orders, are routinely videographed by security staff, the archive of resistance is also an attempt by student protestors to maintain their own visual record of the events.

    <Content>By the middle of 2020, as the first wave of pandemic lockdowns came to an end, the ‘chilling effect’ of various techno-legal initiatives had become very much a reality. Even as COVID-19 positive cases escalated – even as Mumbai alone exceeded all of China in the number of cases – the regulatory impulses of the state grew. In Karnataka, the Seva Sindhu portal sought to integrate all of the state’s Common Service Centres, and made registration compulsory to enter the state. It was not alone: by this time, most states had their equivalent border controls. Aarogya Setu itself, originally set up specifically to fight COVID-19, grew in the time it took to write this essay into a platform that would integrate telemedicine video consultations, an essential building block for India’s National Health Stack. This Health Stack on its side proposed to build on the legacy of India Stack – a series of API-based collaborations permitting Aadhaar verification platforms, an E-KYC mechanism, Unified Payments Interface, a Digilocker, and much else.</Content>

    <Content>It was astonishing to see the Aadhaar template being reprised. Aadhaar was a Planning Commission project, Aarogya Setu a Niti Aayog initiative. The first was a lean-and-mean identity provider and authenticator, the second merely a COVID-19 contact-tracing app. Both were voluntary except you could do practically nothing without either. Both became effectively gateways into a complex network of services: Aadhaar into the Unified Payments area and Aarogya Setu into the health economy.</Content>

    <Content>Contrary to the assertive, aspirational ‘coming out’ that is central to Digital India’s self-image, much recent politics is defined by its very opposite: of making identifiable speaking voices elusive, making spaces ephemeral, defining a fuzzy leaderlessness to political self-assertion. Such elusiveness in turn contextualizes the overly visible incarceration process with which the state has shown off the example of Safoora Zargar and the several young people arrested under the UAPA. Together with the heavy-handed assertion that identity is only what the state provides, such overt displays of control in pandemic times only open up the long colonial ancestry in the assertion, central to sovereign states, that a body has only one identity with no choice in the matter.</Content>
