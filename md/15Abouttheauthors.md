an endowed professor of aesthetics and cultures of technology at ArtEZ
University of the Arts and Radboud University in the Netherlands, a
Faculty Associate at the Berkman Klein Centre for Internet & Society,

**Ashish Rajadhyaksha** worked as Senior Fellow at the Centre for the
Study of Culture and Society. Although known primarily as a film
scholar, he has published widely on digital governance, including the
book *The Last Cultural Mile: An Inquiry into Technology and Governance
in India* (2011), ‘State Power and Technological Citizenship in India:
From the Postcolonial to the Digital Age’ (with Itty Abraham) in *East
Asian Science, Technology and Society: An International Journal* (2015),
and *In the Wake of Aadhaar: The Digital Ecoystem of Governance in
India* (2013).

**Nafis Aziz Hasan** has been researching the techno-politics of digital
media, material politics of public institutions, and technological
policies for governance, with a regional focus on India. One part of his
project seeks to offer a historical understanding of digital technology
in relation to prior technologies of rule. Another aspect of his work
draws on rich ethnographic material on the assemblage of people,
processes, and technologies, generated over a decade from across India.
His work has appeared in academic journals such as *South
Asia*, *Political and Legal Anthropology Review*, and *Economic and
Political Weekly*, and popular outlets such as thewire.in, *New Indian
Express* and raiot.in. This is his first book.
