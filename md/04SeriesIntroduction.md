#Series Introduction

**Overload, Creep, Excess: An Internet from India** is part of a series
of titles supported by the Centre for the Study of Culture & Society
(CSCS), Bangalore, under the broad theme of **Culture and Democracy at
the Millennial Turn**.

Turns of millennia are usually
occasions to review forms of knowledge production for what they have
achieved. In India, however, such an endeavor takes unusual turns.
Politically bracketed by globalization at one end and the onset of
religious majoritarianism at the other, as the current century has worn
on it has turned into something far more significant than merely a
political crisis as we come to terms with the insufficiency of several
founding concepts of modernity such as nation, freedom, identity,
governance, and indeed of power.

Paradoxically, as the current volume shows, this struggle is rendered
especially stark when placed alongside a contrasting, and widespread,
optimism that *also* defined the era. The sudden availability of new
open access research tools once found only in wealthy Western
universities now promised a delirious new freedom as the archives opened
and transdisciplinary and transnational access led to the crumbling of
timeworn disciplinary silos. Variously characterized as the time of the
‘internet’, it was also a time of transborder conversations that only a
scant decade earlier might have been inconceivable, and of the
pluralization of *spaces* for doing theory and *means* by which theory
could be done. While the series defines these spaces and means
diversely, a possible common thread that runs through them will be a
focus on new practices of trans-institutional knowledge production,
typically brought together by the triad of *pedagogy*, *research*, and
*public engagement*, often contextualized by the onset of mass public
digitization.

It was in the spirit of the times that CSCS, together with a range of
new institutions, initiatives, and projects across India, saw its role
as moving beyond the limits of the orthodox institution: inventing the
term ‘inter-institutionality’, contending that the range of research
resources and networks that good interdisciplinary work needed could
never be supported within any single institution, however large or
well-funded.

It is clear that this period did not last. One
sign of its demise may well be the loss of faith in the internet's
neutrality, signaled by meltdowns, funding crises, corruption, fears of
neoliberal excess, terrorist threats, surveillance mechanisms, and new
global ecologies that would soon engulf us in the new century.

As we turn back to the millennial moment, however, such diversity of
both location and method allows us to re-view the dilemmas faced by
academic practice in this fraught era of modern political history. The
diversity of means, in the expanded space of the human sciences, may
need to be viewed alongside the expectation that new practices of
pedagogy and public engagement be given full recognition as research
domains. Both came together – this series proposes – in the larger
academic response mounted to the political challenges of the time.
Across the literature we find outlined an era
that was politically fraught, facing crises that were at once of the
moment and requiring a larger historical frame, capable of some radical
interdisciplinary/institutional barrier-breaking, and sustained if only
momentarily by the temporary convergence of academic-activist drive and
independent support.



## This Volume

The origins of this book lie in a CSCS project assembled by the authors
in 2010. The previous year, the ‘Unique Identity for Every Indian
Resident’ project, better known as Aadhaar (support), had been announced
with much fanfare by the Government of India. Known then as the Identity
Project, it sought over three years to research the grassroots social
impact of mass digitization through detailed field research across seven
Indian states. The multiple outcomes and findings of that particular
project, on paper, PDF, and video, are in the public domain. This volume
is, among other things, a retrospective turn to that epochal moment, and
the decades that both preceded and followed it, using insights that are
very much of the present.
