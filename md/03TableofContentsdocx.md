# OVERLOAD, CREEP, EXCESS – AN INTERNET FROM INDIA

### Nishant Shah, Ashish Rajadhyaksha, Nafis Hasan

Foreword: Chinmayi Arun

## About this book: 

This book locates India’s flourishing internet within a complex 24-year
history that has seen an unprecedented re-organization of social and
political life. Three essays provide independent perspectives on a
common area of inquiry, an era that witnessed a fundamental mutation of
the State, its mechanisms of planning and governance, the public domain
and the everyday, all mediated by digital technology, all impacting its
internet. Bringing the essays together is a common timeline, which
begins in the late 1970s, includes such landmarks as the Information
Technology Act, the much-discussed Aadhaar biometric identification
programme, the chequered career of social media, and the widespread use
of internet shutdowns.
