# Acknowledgments

This book has been long in the making. A lot of it happened even before
the idea of such a book came together. The authors, old collaborators
and friends, thank each other, and will raise a toast whenever it is
that we reconvene, someday, in a single space. Nishant expresses his
gratitude to the people that made the Centre for Internet & Society
possible – Sunil Abraham, Pranesh Prakash, and Nirmita Narsimhan, with
whom it all started and grew. There were some incredible scholars whose
work framed the Internet and Society history in India through its
Researchers At Work series – Asha Achuthan and Namita Malhotra, in
particular. Nishant’s writing owes its intellectual and emotional debt
to different collaborators and interlocutors – Chinmayi Arun, Alexandra
Juhasz, Wendy Chun, David Theo Goldberg, Elizabeth Losh, Martin Warnke,
Malavika Jairam, Clemens Apprich, Rolien Hyong, and Renee Ridgway, who
have all workshopped these different ideas over time. He acknowledges
the generous support of the Digital Earth Project at Hivos and the
Feminist Internet Research Network at the Association of Progressive
Communication, where parts of this work were presented and grew. Ashish
Rajadhyaksha recalls the many colleagues who worked, along with his
co-authors, on the Identity Project at the Centre for the Study of
Culture and Society, and thanks Sruti Chaganti and Kakarala Sitharamam.
A special thanks to <http://pad.ma>, to Lawrence Liang, Shaina Anand and
Ashok Sukumaran. The Identity Project was funded by the Ford Foundation,
Delhi. For advice on 'following the technology', Nafis Hasan is very
grateful to Chris Kelty at UCLA and the wonderful magazine he
co-edits, *LIMN,* particularly Issue 8, which set him on the path of
excavating the stratigraphy of technical structures that lead to the
devastating excesses this book addresses. He is also very thankful for
the grants and research positions that have made the writing and editing
possible.

The authors all remember the Centre for the Study of Culture and
Society, and Tejaswini Niranjana, S.V. Srinivas, and many other faculty
and students there. We are grateful to Geert Lovink and the team of the
Institute of Network Cultures for enabling this book. We express our
deepest thanks to Ravi Sundaram, Chris Kelty, and Michelle Kasprzak for
their detailed, careful, and generous comments on this book, and
Chinmayi Arun for the foreword. Finally, we thank Sunaina Dalaya for her
copyediting, her attention to detail, and for bringing the book together
in such a wonderful way.
